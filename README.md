This is a macOS MenuBar application which makes your mac more secure in public or unsafe environment.
This also happens to be my first time developing an app for macOS.

# How to use it?

# How it works & How I created it?
1. I first tried using AI to get a roadmap & suggestions. I followed it and it was a disaster.
But I learned basic functionalities of Swift and how project management, targets, permissions, etc. work on XCode.

2. I started googling everything and re-built everything from scratch.

- A Helper Tool is installed that communicates with biomanutil to enable/disable TouchID.
- The main app lives in the menu bar where you have a few options to choose from -- all basically leading to enabling/disabling TouchID.

# Declaration of AI Usage
- Getting name inspirations for the app
- Getting a roadmap to create the app -- which did not work, sadly :sob:
- Fixing Bugs
