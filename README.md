This is a macOS MenuBar application which makes your mac more secure in public or unsafe environment.
This also happens to be my first time developing an app for macOS.

# How to use it?
- Mount the dmg file.
- Move FortressMode.app to /Applications
- Run
- Allow apps from unknown developers from Settings
- Install Helper Tool
- Use as you need!

# How it works & How I created it?
- I first tried using AI to get a roadmap & suggestions. I followed it and it was a disaster. But I learned basic functionalities of Swift and how project management, targets, permissions, etc. work on XCode.
- I started googling everything and re-built everything from scratch.
- A Helper Tool is installed that communicates with bioutil to enable/disable TouchID.
- The main app lives in the menu bar where you have a few options to choose from -- all basically leading to enabling/disabling TouchID.
- Now that I've finished building it, it seems easy but it was extremely difficult when I was building it... took me a lot of googling to work my way around things and figure everything out.

# Declaration of AI Usage
- Getting name inspirations for the app
- Getting a roadmap to create the app -- which did not work, sadly :sob:
- Fixing Bugs & Errors
